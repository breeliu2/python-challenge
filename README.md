# python-challenge
For this challenge, I created a new repository for this assignment called python-challenge. 
The repository contains separate files for Pybank and Pypoll. Inside each folder are the following: 
  -CSV file used
  -Analysis containing the text file with results
  -Final script
  
  
 
PyBank Challenge
The main.py script analyzes the financial records of a company. Using a set of financial data found in budget_data.csv I calculated the    following: 
      -The total number of months included in the dataset
      -The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
      -The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes 
      -The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
      -The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period 
      
Here are the results: 
Financial Analysis
----------------
Profit: $22564198

Total Months: 86

Average P/L: $-8311.11

Greatest Increase in Profits: $Jul-16, 1862002

Greatest Increase in Profits: $Jan-14, -1825558



PyPoll Challenge
The pypoll.py script was used to help a small town with their vote counting process. Using a set of poll data found in election_data.csv, I analyzed the votes and calculated the following: 
      -The total number of votes cast
      -A complete list of candidates who received votes
      -The percentage of votes each candidate won
      -The total number of votes each candidate won
      -The winner of the election based on popular vote
      
Here are the Election Results: 
Election Results
--------------------
Total votes: 369711

Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
--------------------
